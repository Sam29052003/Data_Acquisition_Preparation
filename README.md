# Data_Acquisition_Preparation

# Sub Task 1.1

## Project Overview
                                This project demonstrates the complete data acquisition and preparation workflow using Python in VS Code.  
                                Data is collected from multiple sources, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized to prepare it for further analytics or machine learning tasks.

## Data Sources Used
                              - **Excel File (.xlsx)** – Programmatically created using pandas
                              - **CSV File (.csv)** – Product dataset
                              - **REST API** – JSONPlaceholder Users API

## Tools & Libraries
                                - Python
                                - pandas
                                - requests
                                - openpyxl
                                - matplotlib
                                - VS Code

## Steps Performed

## 1. Data Acquisition
                                 - Created and read Excel data using pandas
                                 - Created and read CSV files
                                 - Extracted data from a REST API

### 2. Data Inspection
                                 - Checked data types and metadata using `.info()`
                                 - Generated summary statistics using `.describe()`

### 3. Data Cleaning
                                 - Handled missing values
                                 - Removed duplicates using a unique identifier
                                 - Renamed columns
                                 - Converted data types

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
                                 - Bar chart for student marks
                                 - Bar chart for product prices
                                 - Histogram for marks distribution

### 5. Data Saving 
                                  - Saved cleaned datasets for further analysis
